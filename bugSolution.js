The primary solution involves replacing the incompatible library with an Expo-compatible alternative or one that doesn't rely on native modules.  For example, if you're trying to access device sensors, use Expo's built-in sensor APIs.  If the library is essential and doesn't have an Expo-compatible replacement, consider these alternatives:

1. **Ejecting from Expo:** Ejecting from the Expo managed workflow gives you complete control over the project and allows you to integrate any native module. However, this means you lose some of the benefits of Expo's streamlined workflow.
2. **Using Expo's SDK:**  Expo offers a rich SDK with many functionalities, reducing the need to integrate third-party libraries that may cause incompatibility issues. Check the Expo documentation to see if an available function or API eliminates the need for the problematic library.
