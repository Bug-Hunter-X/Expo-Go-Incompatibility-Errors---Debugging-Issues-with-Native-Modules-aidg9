# Expo Go Incompatibility Errors

This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive issue in Expo development: errors stemming from incompatibilities between libraries and the Expo Go client. Libraries relying on native modules or features unsupported by Expo Go may cause vague errors, hindering debugging.

## Bug Description:
When using certain libraries within an Expo project built using the managed workflow, you may encounter unexpected runtime errors. These errors often lack specific detail, making diagnosis difficult.  The root cause usually lies in a library's dependency on native modules not supported by Expo Go's limited environment.

## Reproduction Steps:
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3.  Run the project using `expo start`.
4. Observe the error that occurs when the application attempts to use the incompatible library.

## Solution:
The most effective solution is to carefully examine library dependencies. Select libraries explicitly designed for Expo or those that don't depend on native modules. If an essential library requires native modules, consider ejecting from the Expo managed workflow to a bare React Native project, allowing for complete native module integration.
