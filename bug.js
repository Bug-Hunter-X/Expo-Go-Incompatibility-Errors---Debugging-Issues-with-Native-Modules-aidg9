This error occurs when using the Expo managed workflow and attempting to use a library that requires native modules or utilizes features not fully supported by the Expo Go client.  The error often manifests as a vague or unhelpful message, such as a general runtime error or a missing module error, and may not directly point to the incompatibility with Expo Go. For example, using a library that depends on native Android or iOS code, such as a library for accessing specific hardware features beyond what Expo provides.
